#Bubble.io Plugin for DeSo Blockchain.
Here you can find code related to creating, signing, and broadcasting transactions on the [DeSo Blockchain](https://www.deso.com/). I created this plugin on bubble.io to simplify the work of my team for a few years working on Green Light Digital and projects like [desonocode.com](https://desonocode.com) or [zirkels.com](https://zirkels.com)

This is a repository based on the [Bubble](https://bubble.io) plugin 'DeSo Blockchain (create, sign & submit txn)'. This lets you use Github's functionality in terms of version control, forks and pull requests. Note that the the plugin code is stored on Bubble's servers, and you need to synchronize your repository in the Bubble Plugin Editor. 

 This plugin can be used in [Bubble applications](https://bubble.io).
